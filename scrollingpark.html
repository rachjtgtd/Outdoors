	<p><b>Indeed there are actual life out here besides us!</b><br>The sun is out giving you that much needed Vitamin D after the harsh Winter.</br> It's so nice seeing the different flowers and other people who are breaking away from the hustle and bustle of everyday. Even the birds here are different! The crisp air coming off the trees are giving you such good energies!<br>Even a cute dog came over to say hi!</br></p>
<h2>Bird watching is cool and all but...</h2>
<p>Birds can fly away where they want, whenever! Maybe it's time for a change in pace?<br><a href="indooradventure.html" target="_blank"> Let's fly elsewhere, but not really cause we're just walking!</a></p>
