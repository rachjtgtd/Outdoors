<p>Heck yeah there is! The coolest part about going to museums is seeing how different their collections can be from each other. The best way to get the biggest bang for your buck is to go on weekdays so everyone will be at work while you get front row standing in front of cool pieces! You can totally see why Bueller took the time to make sure to go to a museum before his day out was through.</p>
